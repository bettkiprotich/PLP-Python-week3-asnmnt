## How it works:
The calculate_discount function checks if the discount percentage is 20% or higher.
If so, it calculates the discounted price and returns it.
Otherwise, it returns the original price.
The user is prompted to enter the price and the discount percentage.
The function is called, and the final price is printed. If no discount is applied, it informs the user.
